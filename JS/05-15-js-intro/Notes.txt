Day 1 : 15.05.2023 -------------------------------------
Curriculum:
📍Introduction to Javascript
📍Language Basics: Variables, Data Types - Primitive and Reference, Number (Add, Sub, Mul, NaN, Infinity), Inbuilt Functions - Numbers
📍Dialogs: Alert, Confirm, Input
📍Control Flow
----------------------------------------------------------
Intoduction:-
    - Javascript file u must have .js extension
    - JS is case-sensitive language.
    - JS is a script language which needs an interpreter
    - It can change HTML & CSS dynamically.
    - Can do events (click, key press etc.)
    - Sending & receiving data to server.
    - Storing the data in cloud/
        ? 1st old JS is client-side.
        ? Became server-side by using Node.js
    - It can perform an action, validation & adds functionality.
    - We can create dynamic web page.
    - We can interact with web page through JS.
    - Without JS web pages are called as Static & dummy pages.

Lang Basics:
    - Ways to insert js code into HTML file:
        1. Using script tag:
            <script>
            //your js code
            </script>
        2. External script (Insert it after body tag):
            <script src="./style.js"></script>
    - Diff between scripting & programming language?
        + Script:
            > Scripting lang is high-level language.
            > Works according to the script like do this & that.
            > Script works on the programming lang.
            > Executes dependently inside the parent. That parent has to be a programming lang.
        + Programming: 
            > Programming lang is low-level language.
            > Executes independently.
    - Where to Practice :
       > VS Code, Browser console in source tb.
       > Its result will be in browser's console tab.

Dialogs: Alert, Confirm, Input
    - alert('Hi, how are you?');

Control Flow
    -

Variables:
    - It is a container to hold some data that can be used that can be used by the program.
    - It means to store some data in memory address.
    - var name = 'Moni';
        -> var means keywordVariable
        -> name means variableName
        -> = means Assignment operator
        -> Moni means variableValue string should be mentioned inside '' | number can be simple given without inside ''| boolean means true & false | array means [] | object means {}

Declare a variable (Syntax):
        -> keywordVariable yourVarName = yourVarValue;

Types of keyword Variables:-
1. var - Global scope variable. | Global means for easy understanding public but we shld not mention like that
------ came after 2015 ES6 (express.js)
2. let - Block scope variables. {}
3. const means never change - Block scope variables. {} | Block means for easy understanding private but we shld not mention like that

What kind of data u r going to store & declaration + initialization of different data.
(5) Types of Data-types:-----------------
1. number - 12233 | Eg: var mathMark = 95;
2. string - 'nsffd' | Eg: var engMark = 'wwww';
3. boolean - true or false | Eg: var tamilMark = true;
4. array - [] | Eg: var socialMark = [];
5. object - {} | Eg: let engMark = {};
//0 means atleast last empty roll is thr 
    5.1 null means one of object nothing empty toilet roll only it's holder
6. undefined means not clearly defined i dont know what is thr in past no holder

💡 console.log(var-name);
    - gives result at browser console
    - it cannot access var-name before its initialization.
    - always we need to declare variables before accessing it.
    - always takes from bottom to top approach.
    - In othr words, last come first according to the rules below.

💡 redeclare means declare again with same var keyword & variable-name with different value.
    Eg: var name = 'qwe';
        var name = '123';

💡 reassign meand assign again without repeating variable keyword but with same variable name with different value.
    Eg: var total = 'qwe';
        total = '123';
📌Rules:-
    1. Var
        > We can reassign & redeclare.
    2. let 
        > We cannot redeclare in same scope.
        > We can redeclare in different scope.
        > We can reassign.
    3. const
        > We cannot redeclare in same scope.
        > We can redeclare in different scope.
        > We cannot reassign.
   📢Notes: scope means a set of code inside a block {}.

Main difference among var, let & const?
    - Var
        > redeclare
            ✅ We can redeclare in same & different scope.
            ✅ Eg: var name = '123'
                    var name = 'abc'
                    console.log(name);
                    Res: abc \\ We can redeclare a global scope variable-name again & again.
        > reassign
            ✅ We can reassign.
            ✅ Eg: var total = '123';
                    var total = 'abc';
                    total = 'wwww';
                    console.log(total);
                    Res: wwww \\ We can reassign a global scope variable-name without mention it's type again.
    - 'let' works on scope-level.
        > redeclare 
            ✅ We cannot redeclare in same scope which will result in error.
                    Eg: let tot = '234';
                        let tot = 'abc';
                   ❌ Warning: We cannot redeclare a block scope variable-name again & again.
            ✅ We cannot redeclare in different scope.
               Eg: let name = '123';
                   {
                    let name = 'abc'; //Block of code
                   }
                    Res: abc
            
        > reassign
            ✅ We can reassign.
                Eg: let total = 'abc';
                    total = 'wwww';
                    console.log(total);
                    Res: wwww
    - 'const' means constant
        > redeclare 
            ✅ We cannot redeclare in same scope which will result in error.
                Eg: const pi = 3.14;
                    pi = 5;
                    console.log(pi);
                     // Res: Error
                ❌ Warning: We cannot redeclare a block scope variable-name again & again.
            ✅ We can redeclare in different scope.
                Eg: const name = 'Ravi';
                    {
                        const name = 'Ravi One';
                        console.log(name);
                        // Res: Ravi One 
                        // like in scenarios like school attendance register
                    }
        > reassign
            ✅ We cannot reassign.

Day 2 : 16-05-2023 agenda: -----------------
    Basic revise (From Day 1)
    Doubts related to Variable and data type-
    Q&A:
    Strings (One of the data type)
    Control Flow statements
-------------------------------
JS handles all the controls in the website
    - how brain controls human body
    - how human contorls the car
What is Variable?
    - It is a container to hold some data.
    - To create a variable, there are some keywords.
What is hoisting?
    - It is moving declaration to the top of the assignment & console and executes the result with value.
    - var name -> declaration
    - name = 'raj'; -> value initialization
    - Eg: name = 123;
          console.log(name);
          var name; // res:123
    - In let & const (more strict & brought discipline in variable declaration), so hoisting is not possible.
Datatype - What type of data u are storing?
    - string: 'name', 'address'
        Eg: var tyre = 'name';
    - number: 12324 ex-phone num, adhaar card not
        Eg: let phone = 123545;
    - boolean: true or false
        Eg: let isTodayMonday = false;
    - object: {} group of related items like variables etc.
        Eg: let tyre = {
            name: 'moni',
            color: 'red',
            owner: 'MRF'
            }
    - array: [] collection of related value
        Eg: let carBrand = [maruthi, tata, java, ]

Day 3 : 17-05-2023 ------------------
Datatypes:
    - string | number | boolean | array |object
In-built methods:
    - predefined rules/codes
    - starts with .
    - Gives us result based on the input

String Methods:-
    >.length
        - It tells how many characters are there in the string.
    >.toUpperCase()
        - It turns all small letter into capital letter.
    >.toLowerCase()
        - It turns all capital letter into small letter.
    >.charAt(3)
        - It shows exact letter at mentioned position.
    >.charCodeAt(4)
        - It shows computer understandable binary (ASCII) code at mentioned position.
        - ASCII -> American Standard Code Information Interchange 
        - If 'm' at 4th position from 0 then it executes m's ascii value 101
    >.trim()
        - It trims from whitespaces before and after of a string.
        - to remove leading and trailing whitespace
    >.trimStart()
        - It trims from whitespaces before of a string.
    >.trimEnd()
        - It trims from whitespaces after of a string.
    >.concat('Morning')
        - It adds two strings (+)
        - adding a string into another string
    >.slice(from, end) 
        - .slice(7,10) or .slice(-3)
        - It takes negative value and start from end position
        - negative number given means it takes from end
    >.substring(3)
        - it won't take negative
        - It don't take negative value and result will be from 0th position always.
    >.indexof('how') 
        - search exactly with word/characters in strings
        - whereas .charAt() mtd will differ as we can mention position in numbers.
    >.startswith('e') 
        - it shows res in boolean T/F if that string starts with given str then true orelse F
    >.

Control Flow
    - how ur code execution happens based on the variables or some operators
    - Conditional statements: if, if-else, switch
        > true or false
        > Eg if-else:   
                let rajesh = 23;
                if(23>18){
                    console.log('He can vote')
                }
                else{
                    console.log('He cannot vote')
                }
        > Eg else-if:   
                let mark = 400;
                if(mark<=400){
                    console.log('C');
                }
                else if(mark <=450){
                    console.log('B')
                }
                else{
                    cosole.log('F')
                }
    - looping statements: for, while , do-while

Day 4 : 18.05.2023 -----------------------
Curriculum:
    - Switch statement
    - for loop
    - while loop
    - do-while loop statement
    - Operators
--------------------------------------
1. Diff between Document.write() & console.log?
    - document.write() used in UI
    - console.log() used in browser/VS code

2. Control flow :-
If-else is used for 2-3 conditions & gives True/False.
Switch Statement
    - It is used for more than 3 conditions

3. Operators :-
    - operators do some operations on operands.
   Types of Operators :-
    1) Arithmetic Operators (+,-,*,/,++a,a++,--a,a--)
        > BODMAS rule (bracket, order means power or roots, division, multiplication, addition, substraction) is the order of operations in calculations.
        > Increment & decrement
            - Pre-Increment - It will increase add 1 and then post value.
            eg:-
            let aa=11;
            console.log(++aa); //Res:12
            console.log(aa); //Res:12
            - Post-Increment - It will post as it is & then increase value for next iteration.
            eg:-
            let aa=11;
            console.log(aa++); //Res:11
            console.log(aa); //Res:12
            - Pre-Decrement - It will decrease and then post value. 
            - Post-Decrement - It will post as it is & then decrease value for next iteration.

            ❌ Dont's
            - we cannot assign increment & decrement to a variable.
            
    2) Assignment Operators (+=,-=,*=,/=,%=)
        > a+=1 shorthand for a=a+1; 
    3) Comparison Operators (<, >, =, <=, >=, ==, ===, !=)
        > we have to determine equality between 2 values.
    4) Logical Operators (&&, ||, !)
        [and, or & not]
        > rule for and: Both shld be T means T, anyone F means F.
        > rule for or: Both T means T , anyone T means T, both F means F.
        > rule for not: T ----> F ; F ----> T.
    5) Conditional (Ternary) Operator
        > Syntax () ? T/F : F/T
        > It assigns the value to the variable based on the condition.
    
Day 5 : 19.05.2023-------------------------------
    Curriculum:-
        - Type Conversion / Coersion
        - Objects
-------------------------------------------------
Type Conversion: One data type to another data type.
    1) Implicit Conversion:-
        - Js will take care
        - Eg: let a = 12 + "";
              console.log(typeof(a)); //Res: string
        - add: if we have add a number and string then a string.
        - mul, div: if we have sub/mul/div a number and string then a number.
    2) Explicit Conversion:-
        - We tell the js to covert into particular type.
        - String(), Number() & Boolean()
        - Eg: convert number to string
              let age = 35;
              let str = String(age);
              console.log(str);
              console.log(typeof(str));
        - Eg: convert string to number
              let person = 'moni';
              let name = Number(person);
              console.log(name);
              console.log(typeof(name));

              Number('') //Res: 0 [Empty String is equal to 0 number]
        - Eg: convert number into boolean
              let a = 0;
              console.log(Boolean(a)); //Res: false

Objects: 
    - A container has group of properties with key & value pairs.
    - collects 2 or more no of information of a variable name.
    - Here variable-name is known as Object.

// Creation of an object
Skeleton/Syntax:-
    let var-name = {
        key:value,
        key1:value1
    }

//how to access particular key from an Object
//Ways to access are (.) & ['']
    i) console.log(var-name.key1);
    ii) console.log(var-name['key']);
              
Day 5 : 22.05.2023 -----------------------------
Curriculum:
    - Assignment 1 discussion
------------------------------------------------
Q-1

Day 5 : 23.05.2023 -----------------------------
Curriculum:
    - Object
    - Arrays
------------------------------------------------
Object
    - It is a heterogeneous datatypes.

Arrays
    - Collection of homogeneous (same kind of) datatypes
    - storing group of values with same references
    - It is denoted by [].
    - Two types of datatypes:
        1. Primitive datatypes => String, Number, Boolean
        2. Non-primitive datatypes => Array & Object is also called as reference data types
    - Declaration of array (Syntax)
      var <array-name> = [comma separated values];
    - Normally we store one by one in each declaration.
    - But using array we can store many values.
    - We no need to assign size for an array in JS.

JSON
    - Javascript Object Notation
    - Array of Objects

Index
    - Position/location of values/items.
    - index starts from 0 to n-1, where n is the number of items
    - Eg: var users = ["Kajal", "Asin", "Hansika", "Genelia", "Keerthy", "Deepika Padukone"];
          console.log(users);
          n=6 & n-1=5
          console.log(users[6]); //undefined
    - Identify an Item using Index postn values
          console.log(users[1]); //Asin
    - Adding an item in an array
          users[6]="Tammanah";
          console.log(users);
    - Length of an array => arr.length;

Methods
    - Push method to insert an array & it will always adds at end => <arr_name>.push("value");
    - Pop method to remove an items from the end => <arr_name>.pop("value");
    - shift & pop won't accept any item in its argument ().
    - push() => it will insert a new item at the end of array
    - pop() => remove an item from the end
    - unshift() => insert an item at the beginning of an array
    - shift() => Delete/remove an item at the beginning of an array
    - problem of using index for adding an item at middle is it removes before item and store new one.
    - To overcome this we use .splice()
    - splice()
       > arr.splice(nth-index, remove how many items, "what item we need to add"); 
       > it will allow us to add an item at any specific position of an array
       > arr.splice(start_index, remove_index, "new-item");
    - sort() => sort / arrange items only in ascending/alphabetical order

**********ANYTHING IN JAVASCRIPT IS CONSIDERED AS AN OBJECT NOT LIKE DATATYPE'S OBJ LIKE IN OOPS CONCEPT*********

    - reverse()=>Reverse an array of items by chaining of methods -> .sort().reverse()
    - concat()=>It will merge arrays
    - isArray()=>to identify array is an array
    - toString()=>converts array to string
    - split()=>It will convert string to an array

Find/Search in net that object is object or not?

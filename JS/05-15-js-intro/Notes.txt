Day 1 : 15.05.2023 -------------------------------------
Curriculum:
📍Introduction to Javascript
📍Language Basics: Variables, Data Types - Primitive and Reference, Number (Add, Sub, Mul, NaN, Infinity), Inbuilt Functions - Numbers
📍Dialogs: Alert, Confirm, Input
📍Control Flow
----------------------------------------------------------
Intoduction:-
    - Javascript file u must have .js extension
    - JS is case-sensitive language.
    - JS is a script language which needs an interpreter
    - It can change HTML & CSS dynamically.
    - Can do events (click, key press etc.)
    - Sending & receiving data to server.
    - Storing the data in cloud/
        ? 1st old JS is client-side.
        ? Became server-side by using Node.js
    - It can perform an action, validation & adds functionality.
    - We can create dynamic web page.
    - We can interact with web page through JS.
    - Without JS web pages are called as Static & dummy pages.

Lang Basics:
    - Ways to insert js code into HTML file:
        1. Using script tag:
            <script>
            //your js code
            </script>
        2. External script (Insert it after body tag):
            <script src="./style.js"></script>
    - Diff between scripting & programming language?
        + Script:
            > Scripting lang is high-level language.
            > Works according to the script like do this & that.
            > Script works on the programming lang.
            > Executes dependently inside the parent. That parent has to be a programming lang.
        + Programming: 
            > Programming lang is low-level language.
            > Executes independently.
    - Where to Practice :
       > VS Code, Browser console in source tb.
       > Its result will be in browser's console tab.

Dialogs: Alert, Confirm, Input
    - alert('Hi, how are you?');

Control Flow
    -

Variables:
    - It is a container to hold some data that can be used that can be used by the program.
    - It means to store some data in memory address.
    - var name = 'Moni';
        -> var means keywordVariable
        -> name means variableName
        -> = means Assignment operator
        -> Moni means variableValue string should be mentioned inside '' | number can be simple given without inside ''| boolean means true & false | array means [] | object means {}

Declare a variable (Syntax):
        -> keywordVariable yourVarName = yourVarValue;

Types of keyword Variables:-
1. var - Global scope variable. | Global means for easy understanding public but we shld not mention like that
------ came after 2015 ES6 (express.js)
2. let - Block scope variables. {}
3. const means never change - Block scope variables. {} | Block means for easy understanding private but we shld not mention like that

What kind of data u r going to store & declaration + initialization of different data.
(5) Types of Data-types:-----------------
number - 12233 | Eg: var mathMark = 95;
string - 'nsffd' | Eg: var engMark = 'wwww';
boolean - true or false | Eg: var tamilMark = true;
array - [] | Eg: var socialMark = [];
object - {} | Eg: let engMark = {};

💡 console.log(var-name);
    - gives result at browser console
    - it cannot access var-name before its initialization.
    - always we need to declare variables before accessing it.
    - always takes from bottom to top approach.
    - In othr words, last come first according to the rules below.

💡 redeclare means declare again with same var keyword & variable-name with different value.
    Eg: var name = 'qwe';
        var name = '123';

💡 reassign meand assign again without repeating variable keyword but with same variable name with different value.
    Eg: var total = 'qwe';
        total = '123';
📌Rules:-
    1. Var
        > We can reassign & redeclare.
    2. let 
        > We cannot redeclare in same scope.
        > We can redeclare in different scope.
        > We can reassign.
    3. const
        > We cannot redeclare in same scope.
        > We can redeclare in different scope.
        > We cannot reassign.
   📢Notes: scope means a set of code inside a block {}.

Main difference among var, let & const?
    - Var
        > redeclare
            ✅ We can redeclare in same & different scope.
            ✅ Eg: var name = '123'
                    var name = 'abc'
                    console.log(name);
                    Res: abc \\ We can redeclare a global scope variable-name again & again.
        > reassign
            ✅ We can reassign.
            ✅ Eg: var total = '123';
                    var total = 'abc';
                    total = 'wwww';
                    console.log(total);
                    Res: wwww \\ We can reassign a global scope variable-name without mention it's type again.
    - 'let' works on scope-level.
        > redeclare 
            ✅ We cannot redeclare in same scope which will result in error.
                    Eg: let tot = '234';
                        let tot = 'abc';
                   ❌ Warning: We cannot redeclare a block scope variable-name again & again.
            ✅ We cannot redeclare in different scope.
               Eg: let name = '123';
                   {
                    let name = 'abc'; //Block of code
                   }
                    Res: abc
            
        > reassign
            ✅ We can reassign.
                Eg: let total = 'abc';
                    total = 'wwww';
                    console.log(total);
                    Res: wwww
    - 'const' means constant
        > redeclare 
            ✅ We cannot redeclare in same scope which will result in error.
                Eg: const pi = 3.14;
                    pi = 5;
                    console.log(pi);
                     // Res: Error
                ❌ Warning: We cannot redeclare a block scope variable-name again & again.
            ✅ We can redeclare in different scope.
                Eg: const name = 'Ravi';
                    {
                        const name = 'Ravi One';
                        console.log(name);
                        // Res: Ravi One 
                        // like in scenarios like school attendance register
                    }
        > reassign
            ✅ We cannot reassign.

Day 2 16-05-2023 agenda: -----------------
    Basic revise (From Day 1)
    Doubts related to Variable and data type-
    Q&A:
    Strings (One of the data type)
    Control Flow statements
-------------------------------
JS handles all the controls in the website
    - how brain controls human body
    - how human contorls the car
What is Variable?
    - It is a container to hold some data.
    - To create a variable, there are some keywords.
What is hoisting?
    - It is moving declaration to the top of the assignment & console and executes the result with value.
    - var name -> declaration
    - name = 'raj'; -> value initialization
    - Eg: name = 123;
          console.log(name);
          var name; // res:123
    - In let & const (more strict & brought discipline in variable declaration), so hoisting is not possible.
Datatype - What type of data u are storing?
    - string: 'name', 'address'
        Eg: var tyre = 'name';
    - number: 12324 ex-phone num, adhaar card not
        Eg: let phone = 123545;
    - boolean: true or false
        Eg: let isTodayMonday = false;
    - object: {} group of related items like variables etc.
        Eg: let tyre = {
            name: 'moni',
            color: 'red',
            owner: 'MRF'
            }
    - array: [] collection of related value
        Eg: let carBrand = [maruthi, tata, java, ]
